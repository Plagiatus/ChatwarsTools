Dungeon Improvements ToDo:

- allow for "chest hunting" paths (in progress, needs improvements)
- allow for custom color sequence for path
- improve sorting algorithm speed by just saving all paths up to 35 but only considering the ones up to a length of 30 for the shorter length, which coupled with adding an index of reasons for weights instead of just the weights to the nodes should eliminate the need for recalculation on algorithm change.
- show path / segment length
- add color option to the distance info numbers

- mark consumables as used / defeated / disabled (esp. fountains, also monsters) and adjust algorithm accordingly
- on mouse hover show info about path / segment / tile (length, monsters, torch useage, etc) (partially done)

- make opacity on surrounding info a setting
